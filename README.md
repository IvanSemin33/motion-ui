## Components

Motion UI offers a diverse collection of more than **30** components, each designed to provide dynamic, interactive, and animated user experiences. These components support a wide range of animation props from the Framer Motion library, making it easy to create stunning visual effects.

## Usage

Using Motion UI is straightforward. Simply import the desired component into your React project and customize it to fit your design requirements. Here's an example of how to use the `Button` component:

```jsx
import { Button, EButtonSizes } from 'motion-ui';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Button
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
      exit={{ scale: 0 }}
      size={EButtonSizes.MEDIUM}
    >
      Click Me
    </Button>
  );
}
```

Each component supports a variety of Framer Motion props, giving you full control over the animation and motion effects applied.

## Customization

Motion UI is highly customizable. You can modify the appearance, behavior, and animation properties of each component to match your project's specific needs. Refer to the documentation for detailed instructions on how to customize the components.
